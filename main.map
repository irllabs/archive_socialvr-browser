These may contain default-value mappings for all tags in the\r\n * oneof but the type tag specifies which one was actually set.\r\n *\r\n * 2) Messages that don't contain a type tag: these are the format required by\r\n * GRPC as inputs. If we emitted objects with type tags, ProtoBuf.js would\r\n * choke claiming that the tags aren't fields in the Message.\r\n *\r\n * Allowing both formats here makes the serializer able to consume the outputs\r\n * it produces: for all messages it supports, fromX(toX(value)) == value.\r\n *\r\n * Note that case 2 suffers from ambiguity: if multiple tags are present\r\n * without a type tag then the callers are structured in such a way that the\r\n * first invocation will win. Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\r\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\r\n * solution.\r\n *\r\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\r\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\r\n * default value for the type. Without the type tag but multiple value tags\r\n * it's possible to have default values for each tag in the oneof and not be\r\n * able to know which was actually in effect.\r\n */\r\nfunction hasTag(obj, type, tag) {\r\n    return type === tag || (!type && tag in obj);\r\n}\n\n/**\r\n * Copyright 2017 Google Inc.\r\n *\r\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n *\r\n *   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n *\r\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n * limitations under the License.\r\n */\r\n/**\r\n * Provides a simple helper class that implements the Stream interface to\r\n * bridge to other implementations that are streams but do not implement the\r\n * interface.

This owner lease is then verified inside every\r\n * transaction to ensure the lease has not been lost.\r\n *\r\n * If a tab opts not to acquire the owner lease (because there's an existing\r\n * non-expired owner) or loses the owner lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a\r\n * failed state and all subsequent operations will automatically fail.\r\n *\r\n * The current owner regularly refreshes the owner lease with new timestamps to\r\n * prevent newly-opened tabs from taking over ownership.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the owner\r\n * lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make sure that\r\n * a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the owner lease).\r\n * Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload since it is\r\n * an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the lease,\r\n * the owner writes its ownerId to a \"zombiedOwnerId\" entry in LocalStorage\r\n * which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and take the\r\n * owner lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\r\n */\r\nvar IndexedDbPersistence = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function IndexedDbPersistence(prefix, serializer) {\r\n        this.ownerId = this.generateOwnerId();\r\n        this.dbName = prefix + IndexedDbPersistence.MAIN_DATABASE;\r\n        this.serializer = new LocalSerializer(serializer);\r\n        this.localStoragePrefix = prefix;\r\n    }\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.start = function () {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        if (!IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable()) {\r\n            this.persistenceError = new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR_MSG);\r\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\r\n        }\r\n        assert(!this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence double-started!');\r\n        this.started = true;\r\n        return SimpleDb.openOrCreate(this.dbName, SCHEMA_VERSION, createOrUpgradeDb)\r\n            .then(function (db) {\r\n            _this.simpleDb = db;\r\n        })\r\n            .then(function () { return _this.tryAcquireOwnerLease(); })\r\n            .then(function () {\r\n            _this.scheduleOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\r\n            _this.attachWindowUnloadHook();\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.shutdown = function () {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        assert(this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence shutdown without start!');\r\n        this.started = false;\r\n        this.detachWindowUnloadHook();\r\n        this.stopOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\r\n        return this.releaseOwnerLease().then(function () {\r\n            _this.simpleDb.close();\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getMutationQueue = function (user) {\r\n        return IndexedDbMutationQueue.forUser(user, this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getQueryCache = function () {\r\n        return new IndexedDbQueryCache(this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getRemoteDocumentCache = function () {\r\n        return new IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache(this.serializer);\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.runTransaction = function (action, operation) {\r\n        var _this = this;\r\n        if (this.persistenceError) {\r\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\r\n        }\r\n        debug(LOG_TAG$3, 'Starting transaction:', action);\r\n        // Do all transactions as readwrite against all object stores, since we\r\n        // are the only reader/writer.\r\n        return this.simpleDb.runTransaction('readwrite', ALL_STORES, function (txn) {\r\n            // Verify that we still have the owner lease as part of every transaction.\r\n            return _this.ensureOwnerLease(txn).next(function () { return operation(txn); });\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable = function () {\r\n        return SimpleDb.isAvailable();\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\r\n     * LocalStorage.\r\n     */\r\n    IndexedDbPersistence.buildStoragePrefix = function (databaseInfo) {\r\n        // Use two different prefix formats:\r\n        //\r\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\r\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\r\n        //\r\n        // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\r\n        // so there's no danger of collisions.\r\n        var database = databaseInfo.databaseId.projectId;\r\n        if (!databaseInfo.databaseId.isDefaultDatabase) {\r\n            database += '.' + databaseInfo.databaseId.database;\r\n        }\r\n        return 'firestore/' + databaseInfo.persistenceKey + '/' + database + '/';\r\n    };\r\n    /**\r\n     * Acquires the owner lease if there's no valid owner.

It will be some version of a server-provided\r\n * document OR will be a server-provided document PLUS acknowledged mutations:\r\n *\r\n *   RemoteDocument' = RemoteDocument + Acknowledged(LocalMutations)\r\n *\r\n * Note that this \"dirty\" version of a RemoteDocument will not be identical to a\r\n * server base version, since it has LocalMutations added to it pending getting\r\n * an authoritative copy from the server.\r\n *\r\n * Since LocalMutations can be rejected by the server, we have to be able to\r\n * revert a LocalMutation that has already been applied to the LocalDocument\r\n * (typically done by replaying all remaining LocalMutations to the\r\n * RemoteDocument to re-apply).\r\n *\r\n * The LocalStore is responsible for the garbage collection of the documents it\r\n * contains. For now, it every doc referenced by a view, the mutation queue, or\r\n * the RemoteStore.\r\n *\r\n * It also maintains the persistence of mapping queries to resume tokens and\r\n * target ids. It needs to know this data about queries to properly know what\r\n * docs it would be allowed to garbage collect.\r\n *\r\n * The LocalStore must be able to efficiently execute queries against its local\r\n * cache of the documents, to provide the initial set of results before any\r\n * remote changes have been received.\r\n *\r\n * Note: In TypeScript, most methods return Promises since the implementation\r\n * may rely on fetching data from IndexedDB which is async.\r\n * These Promises will only be rejected on an I/O error or other internal\r\n * (unexpected) failure (e.g. failed assert) and always represent an\r\n * unrecoverable error (should be caught / reported by the async_queue).\r\n */\r\nvar LocalStore = /** @class */ (function () {\r\n    function LocalStore(\r\n    /** Manages our in-memory or durable persistence. */\r\n    persistence, initialUser, \r\n    /**\r\n     * The garbage collector collects documents that should no longer be\r\n     * cached (e.g. if they are no longer retained by the above reference sets\r\n     * and the garbage collector is performing eager collection).\r\n     */\r\n    garbageCollector) {\r\n        this.persistence = persistence;\r\n        this.garbageCollector = garbageCollector;\r\n        /**\r\n         * The set of document references maintained by any local views.\r\n         */\r\n        this.localViewReferences = new ReferenceSet();\r\n        /** Maps a targetID to data about its query. */\r\n        this.targetIds = {};\r\n        /** Used to generate targetIDs for queries tracked locally. */\r\n        this.targetIdGenerator = TargetIdGenerator.forLocalStore();\r\n        /**\r\n         * A heldBatchResult is a mutation batch result (from a write acknowledgement)\r\n         * that arrived before the watch stream got notified of a snapshot that\r\n         * includes the write. So we \"hold\" it until the watch stream catches up.

In a\\nfuture release, the behavior will change to the new behavior, so if you do not\\nfollow these steps, YOUR APP MAY BREAK.\");\r\n        }\r\n        assert(!this._firestoreClient, 'configureClient() called multiple times');\r\n        var databaseInfo = new DatabaseInfo(this._config.databaseId, this._config.persistenceKey, this._config.settings.host, this._config.settings.ssl);\r\n        var preConverter = function (value) {\r\n            if (value instanceof DocumentReference) {\r\n                var thisDb = _this._config.databaseId;\r\n                var otherDb = value.firestore._config.databaseId;\r\n                if (!otherDb.isEqual(thisDb)) {\r\n                    throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, 'Document reference is for database ' +\r\n                        (otherDb.projectId + \"/\" + otherDb.database + \" but should be \") +\r\n                        (\"for database \" + thisDb.projectId + \"/\" + thisDb.database));\r\n                }\r\n                return new DocumentKeyReference(_this._config.databaseId, value._key);\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                return value;\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        this._dataConverter = new UserDataConverter(preConverter);\r\n        this._firestoreClient = new FirestoreClient(PlatformSupport.getPlatform(), databaseInfo, this._config.credentials, this._queue);\r\n        return this._firestoreClient.start(persistence);\r\n    };\r\n    Firestore.databaseIdFromApp = function (app) {\r\n        var options = app.options;\r\n        if (!contains(options, 'projectId')) {\r\n            // TODO(b/62673263): We can safely remove the special handling of\r\n            // 'firestoreId' once alpha testers have upgraded.\r\n            if (contains(options, 'firestoreId')) {\r\n                throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, '\"firestoreId\" is now specified as \"projectId\" in ' +\r\n                    'firebase.initializeApp.');\r\n            }\r\n            throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, '\"projectId\" not provided in firebase.initializeApp.');\r\n        }\r\n        if (contains(options, 'firestoreOptions')) {\r\n            // TODO(b/62673263): We can safely remove the special handling of\r\n            // 'firestoreOptions' once alpha testers have upgraded.\r\n            throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, '\"firestoreOptions\" values are now specified with ' +\r\n                'Firestore.settings()');\r\n        }\r\n        var projectId = options['projectId'];\r\n        if (!projectId || typeof projectId !== 'string') {\r\n            throw new FirestoreError(Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT, 'projectId must be a string in FirebaseApp.options');\r\n        }\r\n        return new DatabaseId(projectId);\r\n    };\r\n    Object.defineProperty(Firestore.prototype, \"app\", {\r\n        get: function () {\r\n            if (!this._config.firebaseApp) {\r\n                throw new FirestoreError(Code.FAILED_PRECONDITION, \"Firestore was not initialized using the Firebase SDK.
