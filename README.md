## Social VR Editing Tool

### About
Browser based editor tool for the Social VR project.

### Tools Used
* Angular 2 - application framework
* TypeScript - a strictly typed superset of JavaScript.
* SCSS - a superset of CSS that allows imports, variables, and more.
* PostCss - obviates the need for vendor prefixes in CSS files.
* WebPack - provides JS bundling, an easy to use dev server, build options, and more.
* ThreeJS - Cross-browser 3D graphics with WebGL.
* Docker containers inside VSCode Editor.

### Installation and Usage
- See [WIKI page on Browser Editor Local Build](https://github.com/cmuartfab/social-vr/wiki/Browser-Editor-Local-Build)
- See [WIKI page on CSS design instructions](https://github.com/cmuartfab/social-vr/wiki/Browser-Editor-CSS-Architecture)

#### Docker and VScode
Using VSCode you need to install the specific development extensions, more info: [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

After all the dependencies are installed, you need to:

1) Clone this repo.
2) Start VS Code within the repo and click on the quick actions Status Bar item in the lower left corner of the window.
3) Click on Re Open in container. This will create and image of this repo.
4) In VScode go to terminal: New Terminal.
5) Run `npm install` to install all dependencies. 
6) Proceed as below.

### Local Builds
* Point to a locally running server: ```npm run dev-local```
* Point to the staging server: ```npm run dev``` this will open the application on port 3000.
* Point to production: ```npm run dev-prod```

### Deploy
At the moment, deployments are manual. These scripts will deploy whatever is in your current directory so it is important to be careful.

* Deploy to staging: ```npm run deploy```
* Deploy to production:
```sh
npm run build:prod;
# Make sure it built: ls -al ./dist;
# copy to prod server
scp -r ./dist/* irlab@irl.studio:/home/irlab/socialvr.irl.studio;
```
Note that `npm run deploy` and `npm build:prod` build the project in different ways.
* `npm run deploy` points to the staging API server
* `npm run build:prod` points to the production API server. Also, it minifies all the JavaScript so the project can move to the browser quicker.

##### Extra safe prod deployment (deploy what is currently in master)
```sh
#!/bin/bash

# clone single branch of repo without history
git clone --depth 1 --branch master git@github.com:cmuartfab/socialvr-browser.git;

# move into cloned repo
cd socialvr-browser;

# install dependencies
npm install;

# build project
npm run build:prod;

# ls -al ./dist;

# copy to prod server
scp -r ./dist/* irlab@irl.studio:/home/irlab/socialvr.irl.studio;
```

### Architecture
* CLEAN, or "layered" architecture as described [here](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
* We have three layers, from outside in they are: "UI", "Core", and "Data".  The UI layer is split into two sub-layers: "view" and "presentation".
* The "view" is the markup for a UI component. This layer should only be responsible for getting / setting primitive types, and simple view logic (conditionally hiding or showing, and repeating over elements).
* The "presentation" layer is the TypeScript class for a component.  This layer should be responsible for providing data to the view, and acting on click events. Complex view logic should also be in the presentation layer.
* The "Core" layer provides use-cases.  This layer should provide methods to the presenter so that it can interact with data.
* The "Data" layer holds application state and interfaces with network and disk storage.
